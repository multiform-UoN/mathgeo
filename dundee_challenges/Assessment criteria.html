<p>Case Officers should complete the assessment set out in this Annex to
determine whether seeking specialist advice is required.  Please use

the document download section.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment criteria for all elements of the development
mentioned in the EIA report.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Raised Bog supporting ‘typical’ bog vegetation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Yes: Likely National Interest</em></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Montane Bog supporting ‘typical’ bog vegetation or
characteristics (see C&amp;D below).</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Yes: Likely National Interest</em></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Blanket Bog – (based on quality criteria used in identifying
potential SSSI).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3a. Is the proposed development within a continuous unit of blanket
bog &gt;25ha?</p>
<p><em>Yes: Go to B</em></p>
<p><em>No: Advise on compliance with the mitigation hierarchy and on
mitigation measures for Electricity Act cases. Provide ‘no comment’
response for Planning Act cases.</em></p>
<p>3b. Does the proposed development footprint and/or the wider area of
blanket bog of which it is a part, support vegetation capable of forming
peat?</p>
<p><em>Yes: Go to C</em></p>
<p><em>No: Advise on compliance with the mitigation hierarchy and on
mitigation measures for Electricity Act cases.  Provide ‘no comment’
response for Planning Act cases.</em></p>
<p>3c. Does the proposed development footprint (with a buffer of 250m)
support two or more of the following?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Low frequency of drains and peat cutting</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Presence of plant species indicating peat formation capability
and/or lack of disturbance</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>An area of natural surface pattern</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Absence of invasion by woodland or scrub</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Yes: Possible National Interest - consult adviser</em></p>
<p><em>No: Go to D</em></p>
<p>3d. Does the proposed development footprint (with a buffer of 250m)
support one or more of the following?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An abundance of <em>Sphagnum</em>-rich ridges</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Ridges of <em>Sphagnum</em> - <em>Betula nana</em></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Hummocks of <em>S. fuscum</em> or S. <em>austinii</em></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Peat mounds</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Hollows of <em>Sphagnum</em> or bare peat - <em>Rhynchospora
fusca</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Yes: Possible National Interest - consult adviser</em></p>
<p><em>No: Advise on mitigation measures</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Likely national interest</strong> – These habitats are
particularly sensitive to any impacts, and restoration is difficult to
achieve so it is expected that there will be impacts on peatland of
national interest.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Possible national interest</strong> – It is possible that
there will be an impact to peatland of national interest, specialist
advice is required and potentially a site visit.</em></p>
